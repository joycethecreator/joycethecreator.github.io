## TL;DR
I designed and executed an **experimental stage lighting system** for *Carmen: L’amour est un oiseau rebelle*, serving as both **lighting designer and lighting crew**.  
The project explored how **light color, intensity, and timing** can shape emotional rhythm and reinforce performance dynamics in a live theatrical setting.

---

## Overview
This project is a lighting-focused interpretation of *Carmen: L’amour est un oiseau rebelle*.  
Rather than treating lighting as purely functional, the goal was to use light as an **active storytelling element**, responding to music, movement, and emotional shifts in the performance.

---

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to:
- Experiment with lighting as an expressive medium
- Translate musical and emotional cues into visual rhythm
- Explore how minimal staging can be elevated through intentional lighting design

The piece emphasizes contrast — freedom vs restraint, playfulness vs tension — using light as the primary visual language.

## My Roles

### Lighting Designer
- Designed the overall lighting concept and visual language
- Selected color palettes to match musical phrasing and emotional beats
- Planned cue timing to align with performance structure

### Lighting Crew
- Installed all lighting equipment
- Handled physical setup, focusing, and adjustment of fixtures
- Ensured safe and stable rigging for the performance environment

This dual role required balancing **conceptual design decisions** with **practical, on-site execution**.

---

## Methodology

### Concept Development
- Studied the musical and emotional arc of *Carmen*
- Identified key moments where lighting could heighten tension or release
- Chose colors and contrasts that reinforced character dynamics

### Technical Setup
- Installed and positioned lights to support both performers and spatial depth
- Adjusted angles and intensity to avoid flattening faces or overpowering movement
- Tested visibility, shadows, and transitions in rehearsal conditions

### Cue Design & Iteration
- Refined lighting cues through rehearsal observation
- Adjusted timing and intensity based on performer movement and pacing
- Balanced dramatic effect with clarity and audience comfort

---

## Results
- Delivered a cohesive lighting design that actively supported the performance
- Demonstrated how lighting alone can define mood and structure
- Gained hands-on experience integrating artistic intent with real-world constraints

The final result shows lighting functioning as a **performative partner**, not just illumination.
