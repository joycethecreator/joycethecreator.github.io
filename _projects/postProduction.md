## Overview
This project is a **collection of post-production experiments** focused on editing style, color treatment, and visual rhythm. Rather than producing original narrative films, the goal was to explore how **post-production choices alone** can dramatically reshape tone, pacing, and emotional impact.

---

## Focus Areas
- **Color grading experiments**  
  Exploring mood through contrast, saturation, and color balance.

- **Fan-made trailer edits**  
  Recutting existing footage to reinterpret story, genre, or tone using pacing, music, and structure.

- **Stylistic post-production studies**  
  Editing exercises emphasizing rhythm, transitions, and visual cohesion.

---

## Tools & Techniques
- **Adobe Premiere Pro** for editing and sequencing
- **Adobe After Effects** for simple visual effects and motion elements
- Music-driven editing to study timing and emotional cues

---

## Outcome
These studies strengthened practical skills in:
- non-linear editing
- color-driven storytelling
- visual consistency across cuts

They also reinforced how post-production can function as a **creative, narrative tool**, not just a technical finishing step.
