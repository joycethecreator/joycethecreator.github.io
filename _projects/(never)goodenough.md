## TL;DR
I contributed across the full pipeline of a student film as **producer, editor, and camera operator**. I coordinated production planning and on-set execution, captured footage on camera, and delivered the final edit with pacing, continuity, and sound/image polish.

---

## Purpose
This project was created as a student narrative film focused on clear visual storytelling and efficient small-crew production. The goal was to deliver a coherent short film under real constraints: limited time, limited crew, and tight shooting schedules.

---

## My Roles

### Producer
- Organized the shoot plan and kept the production on schedule
- Coordinated logistics (locations, time blocks, equipment needs)
- Supported team communication and made sure deliverables stayed aligned

### Camera Operator
- Shot key scenes and coverage to support the edit
- Focused on framing, exposure, and continuity between takes
- Worked with the director/team to execute the visual plan

### Editor
- Built the final cut from selects, organizing footage for speed and consistency
- Shaped pacing and emotional beats through timing and shot selection
- Cleaned continuity, tightened scenes, and delivered a polished final export

## Methodology (How I approached the work)

### Pre-production
- Broke down the story into shootable beats
- Identified critical shots needed for narrative clarity and editing flexibility
- Planned for coverage to protect the edit (wide/medium/close-ups, inserts)

### Production
- Captured footage with consistency (framing, eyelines, screen direction)
- Prioritized clean audio and stable shots where possible
- Adjusted shot strategy based on time constraints while protecting the story

### Post-production
- Organized footage into bins by scene and take
- Assembled a rough cut, then iterated through tightening and continuity passes
- Finalized the cut with basic color/contrast balancing and audio leveling

---

## Results
- Delivered a complete student short film with a clear story arc and cohesive pacing
- Built production experience spanning planning, filming, and post
- Strengthened my ability to work across roles while maintaining quality under constraints
