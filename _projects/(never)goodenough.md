## TL;DR
I worked across the full filmmaking pipeline as **producer, camera operator, and editor**, supporting production logistics on set and shaping the final film through editing, color refinement, and audio mixing in post-production.

## My Roles

### Producer
- Coordinated production logistics, including scheduling, locations, and equipment planning  
- Kept the shoot organized and on schedule under time constraints  
- Supported communication between crew members to ensure smooth execution  

### Camera Operator
- Shot key scenes and coverage with attention to framing, exposure, and continuity  
- Maintained visual consistency across takes to support editing flexibility  
- Collaborated with the director and crew to execute the planned visual language  

### Editor / Post-Production
- Assembled the film from raw footage, organizing clips by scene and take for efficient iteration  
- Refined pacing, continuity, and emotional rhythm through multiple editing passes  
- Performed basic color correction and stylistic color grading to unify shots and enhance mood  
- Balanced dialogue, ambient sound, and music through audio leveling and cleanup 
- Delivered a polished final cut suitable for presentation and screening

## Approach & Workflow

### Pre-production
- Broke down the script into shootable units and editing needs  
- Identified essential coverage (wide, medium, close-ups, inserts) to protect the edit  
- Planned shot continuity and transitions with post-production in mind  

### Production
- Captured footage with consistent framing, screen direction, and exposure  
- Adapted shot plans as needed while maintaining narrative clarity  
- Prioritized usable audio and stable coverage for post-production flexibility  

### Post-production
- Organized footage into structured bins to streamline editing  
- Built a rough cut and iteratively refined timing, transitions, and continuity  
- Applied color adjustments to correct exposure and establish visual coherence  
- Mixed and leveled audio to ensure clarity and balance across scenes
