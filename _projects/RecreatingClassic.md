## Overview
This project consists of **shooting and editing recreated scenes from classic films** as a hands-on study in cinematography and videography. The goal was to closely analyze how visual language is constructed through framing, lighting, and camera movement.

---

## Focus Areas
- Shot composition and blocking
- Camera movement and lens choice
- Lighting setups and contrast
- Continuity and visual rhythm through editing

---

## Process
Each study involved:
- analyzing an original scene shot-by-shot
- planning camera placement and lighting to match the source
- filming and editing the recreated version for comparison

This iterative process emphasized **learning through replication**, a common training method in cinematography education.

---

## Outcome
The project strengthened technical understanding of visual storytelling and improved practical skills in:
- cinematography
- videography
- non-linear editing

It also reinforced how subtle choices in camera and lighting shape audience perception.
