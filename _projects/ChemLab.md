## TL;DR
A **web-based, photorealistic chemistry lab simulator** built in Unity to teach essential laboratory techniques—most notably **accurate meniscus reading**—successfully used by **500+ students** for remote and supplemental lab training.

---

## Purpose
Introductory chemistry students often struggle with fundamental lab skills due to:
- limited physical lab access
- time pressure during in-person labs
- lack of visual clarity when learning precise techniques

This project was designed to provide a **high-fidelity, repeatable training environment** that allows students to practice critical lab operations **before** entering a physical lab.

---

## Educational Context
The simulator was deployed as part of an **online learning workflow**, supporting:
- remote instruction
- pre-lab preparation
- skill reinforcement outside scheduled lab hours

Its design prioritizes **clarity, realism, and instructional accuracy** over gamification.

---

## Methodology

### 1) Photorealistic 3D visualization
Unity was used to create **accurate, photorealistic models** of laboratory glassware and instruments, with particular focus on:
- transparent materials
- liquid surface curvature
- lighting conditions that affect visual perception

This visual fidelity is essential for correctly teaching **meniscus reading**, a skill that depends on subtle optical cues.

---

### 2) Meniscus reading training
The simulator guides students through:
- identifying the correct eye level
- recognizing concave vs convex meniscus shapes
- reading volume measurements accurately from glassware

Students can repeat the process multiple times, reinforcing correct technique through visual repetition rather than trial-and-error in a real lab.

---

### 3) Integrated lab procedures
Beyond meniscus reading, the simulator integrates full procedural workflows, including:
- **spectrophotometer operation**
- **burette handling and measurement**
- step-by-step experimental processes

This allows students to understand how individual techniques fit into broader lab experiments.

---

### 4) Web-based deployment
The lab was deployed as a **web application**, making it:
- easily accessible without local installation
- compatible with remote learning environments
- scalable to large student populations

This deployment choice significantly lowered barriers to adoption.

---

## Results & Impact
- Successfully used by **500+ students**
- Improved student confidence with basic lab operations
- Reduced time spent in physical labs correcting foundational mistakes
- Enabled consistent instruction across large course sections

Instructors reported smoother lab sessions due to students arriving better prepared.

---

## Role
**Unity Developer**  
Responsibilities included:
- photorealistic 3D environment creation
- interaction design and procedural flow
- web deployment and optimization for student use

---

## Takeaway
This project demonstrates how **real-time 3D simulation** can be applied beyond games to deliver **measurable educational impact**, especially in environments where physical resources are limited.
